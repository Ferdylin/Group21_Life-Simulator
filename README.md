## 2. Game introduction
Some lives are uneventful, some are bumpy, yet for most people, life is a path with no turning back and every choice is crucial to life.
This game simulates life from the age of 13 to 36, giving players a chance to restart their lives. Different choices will lead to changes in personal parameters, resulting in a variety of endings, allowing players to experience different life.

## 3. Game rules
#### Age range: 13-36
#### 
1. Character stats will be made up of three variables:
#### health\wealth\satisfaction, Each variable will have a value between 0 and 3 (They cannot go beyond 3 or go below 0).

2. At the beginning of the game, the player will choose whether to load a fresh game (by entering '1') or a saved game (by entering '2').

3. If the user decides to load a new game, they must provide the name of an empty.txt file or a.txt file that does not exist in the current directory (eg: save.txt). This is the file that will be loaded if the user decides to load a saved game in a subsequent run.

4. If the user wishes to load a previously saved game, they must provide the name of a.txt file in which the game progress was previously stored.
The new game begins with a character at the age of 13 with upgradable attributes.

5. After each age is completed, the user enters '1' at the conclusion of each year to grow up and progress to the next age. The user may also quit and save the game by pressing '2'.

6. Each year, random events will be generated: events in the four "main" years will be determined by character attributes and will consist solely of choice-based events.

7. Random events will be chosen at random from a library of presets, and will comprise of statement- and choice-based events.
The user will be presented with a selection of replies to choice-based events from which to choose.

8. To choose it, the user enters a number matching to the answer of their choosing.

9. Each option may have an effect on one or more variables of the character's stats. Because the data have a range of 0-2, 0 is the least and 2 is the highest.

10. The user may view the.txt file that was used to save the game as a summary at the conclusion of the game.
